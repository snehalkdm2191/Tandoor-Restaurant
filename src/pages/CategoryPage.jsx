              A vegan lifestyle prevents a tremendous amount of animal slaughter
              and suffering. It offers a potent way to shrink our environmental
              footprint, especially in regard to climate change. And a
              well-planned vegan diet can fuel the highest levels of fitness,
              while reducing our risk of various chronic diseases. Plus, the
              food is insanely delicious{" "}

              When it comes to cocktails, I like them to be refreshing, and this
              mocktail is the perfect summer refreshment. Sparkling water gives
              it the bubbly replacement of alcohol, whilst kombucha adds even
              more fizziness and flavour â€“ and did I mention this will not only
              boost your good gut bacteria, but that the chia seeds will also
              give you a great hit of healthy Omega oils? Green Matters compiled
              an extensive roundup of vegan Nirvana drinks to try, aside from
              black coffee or cold brew with almond milk, of course. The options
              are truly endless, and trust us, your coffee run is about to get
              exponentially more interesting.
